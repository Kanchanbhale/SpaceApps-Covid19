Here is the preview of challenges :<br>
<br>
<h2>Quiet Planet</h2>
The COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting social distancing recommendations and related restrictions have led to numerous short-term changes in economic and social activity around the world, all of which may have impacts on our environment. Your challenge is to use space-based data to document the local to global environmental changes caused by COVID-19 and the associated societal responses.
<br>
<br>

<h2>Light the Path</h2>
The COVID-19 pandemic initiated changes in human population movements and activities around the world. Your challenge is to use Earth observations to explore how human activity and regional land-based human movement patterns may have shifted in response to COVID-19.
<br>
<br>

<h2>Where There’s a Link, There’s a Way</h2>
Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, there has been a proliferation of websites and portals developed to share resources about the topic. Your challenge is to find innovative ways to present and analyze integrated, real-time information about the environmental factors affecting the spread of COVID-19.
<br>
<br>
<h2>A New Perspective</h2>
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, protected areas and other forms of wilderness areas (e.g., arboretums, beaches, parks, marine monuments) have been closed worldwide. Your challenge is to lead the effort to examine any potential impacts of reduced human traffic in such local protected natural environments.
<br>
<br>
<h2>The Art of It All</h2>
What have you learned about yourself or the world as a result of living through the COVID-19 pandemic? Your challenge is to express your experience of living through this historic time through a work of art.
<br>
<br>
<h2>SDGs and COVID-19</h2>
This challenge invites you to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by looking at the current and ongoing change in the monitoring indicators of the UN SDGs using Earth observation/remote sensing and global Earth system model-derived analysis products.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Food for Thought</h2>
Your challenge is to consider the journey of food to your plate, determine how disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic are affecting the food supply locally and globally, and propose solutions to address these issues.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Purify the Air Supply</h2>
Has your time spent indoors increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of stay-at-home and shelter-in-place policies worldwide? Your challenge is to use the International Space Station (ISS) as inspiration and develop a system to monitor and/or purify indoor air. It is entirely up to you whether the system you design is able to be used on Earth (for example in homes, businesses, transportation, etc.) and/or in space.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Human Factors</h2>
The emergence and spread of infectious diseases, like COVID-19, are on the rise. Can you identify patterns between population density and COVID-19 cases and identify factors that could help predict hotspots of disease spread?
<br>
<br>
<h2>The Isolation Solution</h2>
Social distancing policies enacted the world over during the COVID-19 pandemic have left many people socially isolated. Your challenge is to develop innovative solutions to combat social isolation.
<br>
<br>
<h2>A World Away</h2>
Your challenge is to identify pandemic social problems that may have collateral effects in space, prepare for the collateral effects in space, and/or to evaluate on-Earth support and in-space risks, to include psychological and technical risks.
<br>
<br>
<h2>An Integrated Assessment</h2>
Your challenge is to integrate various Earth Observation-derived features with available socio-economic data in order to discover or enhance our understanding of COVID-19 impacts.
